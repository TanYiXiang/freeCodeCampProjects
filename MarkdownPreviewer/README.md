A *FreeCodeCamp* challenge on using front end libraries to build a markdown previewer with the below user stories to be fulfilled:

> **Required**
> 1. I can see a `textarea` element with a corresponding `id="editor"`.
> 2.  I can see an element with a corresponding `id="preview"`.
> 3. When I enter text into the `#editor` element, the `#preview` element is updated as I type to display the content of the textarea.
> 4. When I enter GitHub flavored markdown into the `#editor` element, the text is rendered as HTML in the `#preview` element as I type (HINT: You don't need to parse Markdown yourself - you can import the Marked library for this: https://cdnjs.com/libraries/marked).
> 5. When my markdown previewer first loads, the default text in the `#editor` field should contain valid markdown that represents at least one of each of the following elements: a header (H1 size), a sub header (H2 size), a link, inline code, a code block, a list item, a blockquote, an image, and bolded text.
> 6. When my markdown previewer first loads, the default markdown in the `#editor` field should be rendered as HTML in the `#preview` element.
